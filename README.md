TODO: put together test.py unittest suite in order to:

* verify correctness** (minimal vs maximal specifications)
* benchmark performance (time + space): dev-time (tough, because learning & improved familiarity with task, etc) vs build-time vs run-time vs build size vs dynamic memory usage vs etc
* include Makefile to more cleanly interface with all implementations via proxy?
